/** Blog.js will be a component hosted in a separate route. The blog is somewhere
 * where I can post updates of my life, both personal and career oriented. It's
 * mostly for fun - and will be a good way to express myself!
 *
 * Blog.js will be cut into 2 content sections - one containing blog posts
 * and the other containing pictures that I upload.
 *
 * BlogPosts will be listed in Blog.js, and have a preview of the content of the
 * full blog post. User's can click on the preview to show the full blog post.
 *
 * PicturePosts will be listed on the right side of Blog.js. The pictures will
 * have a preview and a title of the picture. The user can click on the picture
 * to have an expanded version of the picture appear. It would be nice to also
 * have a description of the picture (optional).
