          A blog is an interesting component. They allow you to communicate the
          things that you're doing, whether that be coding or eating a delicous
          dessert. I got the idea to start a blog from my research in AWS
          Serverless technologies like Lambda. I saw this great YouTube video
          from a creator Emily Shea. Following the stream of info she put out, I
          landed on her personal webpage and thought:
        </p>
        <span>Teaching people is a great way to teach yourself</span>
        <p>
          So I'm going to create a blog component. As I learn new things, I'll
          create posts to share with people the things I've learned, and get
          some awesome review as an additional bonus.

          My best friend <b>Thomas Duliban</b> and I have been talking about the
          war between Ukraine and Russia. Conflict is never a pretty thing. I
          personally hate all types of conflict. I'm a lover, not a fighter, and
          hearing about the ambitions of men devolving society into a mess
          bothers me. Tom saw a flier about an organization, UECC, getting
          involved to help the Ukrainian people. He reached out to me asking if
          I'd like to come with him to pick up some things to donate, and I
          couldn't say no. Together, with the donations of 8 people, we bought
          supplies and donated them.
