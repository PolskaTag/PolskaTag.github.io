# Welcome to my [Portfolio!](https://philiplapinski.com/)

Portfolio... a fun word to say to be sure, and an important part of anyone's personal inventory. I created this to tell the world about myself and simultaneously become a better developer. One of the great things I love about developing is the freedom and speed in which you can start creating and observing. This is especially true for front-end work such as web developement. This portfolio is just that, and as a testament to becoming a better developer, I decided it'd be a good idea to design this thing before I jump into creating random divs and such.

## The Design (Figma)

The following pictures are **frames** from Figma that capture the different sections of my portfolio. This prototyping took me about a full day to finish, and at that point not a single line of code was written. That's something I wasn't very used to doing. I'm one of those "eager to get going" type of people, but I know the value that designing brings to table when it's go time. And indeed it did, once I had a visual reference to the thing I was building, I experienced this "flow state" where I was able to keep implementing without having to stop and think of the thing to do next. That is the great benefit that designing and prototyping offers.

### Blog
A blog is an interesting component. They allow you to communicate the things that you're doing, whether that be coding or eating a delicous dessert. I got the idea to start a blog from my research in AWS Serverless technologies like Lambda. I saw this great YouTube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdyhdnWVukc) from a creator **Emily Shea**. Following the stream of info she put out, I landed on her personal [webpage](https://emshea.com/) and thought:

> Teaching people is a great way to teach yourself

So I'm going to create a blog component. As I learn new things, I'll create posts to share with people the things I've learned, and get some awesome review as an additional bonus.

## Architecture
